# Tasks:
# Create a Numbered List of Students
# Print each studentâ€™s name with a number starting from 1 (e.g., 1. Alice).

# Pair Students with Their Scores Using enumerate()
# Combine both lists to display each student's name alongside their score.

# Find Positions of High Scorers
# Identify and print the positions (indices) of students who scored above 90.

# Map Positions to Student Names
# Create a dictionary where keys are positions (starting from 0) and values are the student names.
